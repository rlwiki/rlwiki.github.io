## [Asshole Buyers Hall of Shame](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/9boy5e/discussion_to_all_the_shitheads_ive_loathed_before/)

If only we could name names...

Why be a jerk when you can be nice to your seller and to us, too? All caps and threats will get you nothing and nowhere. Don't tell a seller that you're going to call the police. Leave law enforcement alone so they can focus on apprehending rapists and murderers. OC not agreeing to an exchange or refund because you feel the 3mm misalignment of your contraband NF is ruining your life isn't high on their priority list. The po-po aren't sympathetic towards rep buyers to begin with not to mention they have zero jurisdiction over an individual in China. Good luck trying to get the Chinese police on your side. Seriously, you're just wasting your time (and ours). Take the loss and move on. 

What is with the vile, inexcusable racism? There's a special place in hell for a certain kind of garbage person, but until then, [we'll settle for making sure some of the more popular RL sellers answers a single one of your messages ever again](https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZCTCZiOwJGDaTAF21f/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e471c8bnf5rjnk8ogciyfuzz3u8yjvif00eo80gdhz8&rid=giphy.gif).
