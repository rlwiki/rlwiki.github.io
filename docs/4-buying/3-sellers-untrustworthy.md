#### Angel (QinQin Factory)

 - WeChat
  - bao0814
  - z915339250
  - QinQin-Factory
 - WhatsApp 
  - +86 136 8227 1165
  - +86 180 6550 7552
 - Skype - QinQin.factory
 - Email 
  - QinQin.Factory@hotmail.com
  - qinqin.factory@gmail.com
 - [Yupoo](http://qinqin-factory.x.yupoo.com/)
 - Reddit username - `u/qinqin_luxury_brand`

Angel who also operates under QinQin or QinQin Factory, the name of the seller consortium she works under, has been removed from our TS List. `u/Rep_Dad` sent $550 through Bitcoin for an order. He mistakenly transferred $5500. Angel denied receiving the money and an effort made by the mod team to recover the funds was unsuccessful. First, Angel claimed the WeChat ID the buyer had been corresponding with was not hers. A lie considering the ID was on the TS List and in several of her spamming posts she's made on RL that we've been removing on a daily basis for months. She then claimed the account belonged to her coworker and she would check with that individual to confirm if the money was ever received. A day later, the buyer provided proof that the funds, which had previously been in Angel's or their Bitcoin intermediary's account, was transferred out and is no longer traceable by him. 

The complete timeline of events and substantial evidence including screenshots, Bitcoin confirmation, and the mod teams' correspondence with Angel/QinQin can be viewed [here](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/e1tjdj/a_major_financial_mistake_help_needed_with_ts/) in addition to a subsequent [update](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/e3hhqj/psa_removal_of_qinqin_factory_from_the_ts_list/). An attempt was made to communicate with her in Mandarin to ensure things were not being misconstrued in translation. We found that was not the case. Angel confirmed that a former colleague stole the money, still had access to one of QinQin's WeChat IDs and was able to access the Bitcoin transfer somehow. Her story is highly suspect, and frankly, not remotely believable. 

Angel eventually succumbed to pressure and agreed to repay the buyer. As of this point, he's received $3000 with the remainder on the way. However, it was very clear to us that she had no intention on resolving this issue had it not been exposed on RL, thus Angel and QinQin will remain on this list indefinitely.

#### Annie Lin

 - WeChat
  - Lucy-love-duo
  - LYC13148866

Annie Lin is a rep jewelry seller who stole money from multiple RL members. `u/luxebaggal` [sent her $130 in November 2017 for several accessories](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7i41tu/has_anyone_heard_from_annie_lin_jewelry/). After receiving PSP and asking a question about one of the items, Annie went silent on her and ignored all subsequent follow-ups. `u/luxebaggal`'s full timeline and final updates on her transaction can be viewed [here.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/8h7le1/warning_about_annie_lin_luxury_brand/) 

A similar situation occurred with `u/eurydice2412` around the same time. [She purchased VCA jewelry prior to Christmas.](https://imgur.com/SyXYYub) She reached out to ask when she could expect PSP, but never heard from Annie again. Needless to say, `u/eurydice2412` did not get her order or her money back. As additional complaints about Annie surfaced on RL, we discovered even more people she cheated. `u/PurseObsessed` [never received anything after sending payment](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7ioyyu/seller_review_how_to_shop_with_annie_lin_step_1/dr3mwwz/) as did `u/ne1enka79` who bought [Chanel brooches] (https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7ioyyu/seller_review_how_to_shop_with_annie_lin_step_1/) and [was out $200.](https://imgur.com/LuHH8Z0) Soon after, Annie stopped updating her Moments. At some point, she had told a few people that she was no longer selling and had returned to school, but she reappeared on WeChat in April 2018. 

Annie has a clear and simple modus operandi: she takes the order, insists on WU, then vanishes. Many buyers have lost hundreds of dollars with her. This is not a case where you will receive an inferior product. You won't be getting anything at all.

#### Benny

 - WeChat
  - H13533143180
  - M-baopopo (Alternate)
  - feel9254 (Second Alternate)
 - WhatsApp 
  - +86 137 6334 1061
  - +86 137 1121 9327
 - Email - 269101719@qq.com
 - [Yupoo](http://x.yupoo.com/photos/706325/albums?tab=gallery)

Benny and his wife Jena have the distinction of being the only sellers removed from the TS List for theft. `u/ejo999` [posted about her experience with a monthslong delayed order](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gt69wf/waiting_5_months_for_3_bags_from_ts_benny/), which prompted quite a few others to share similar issues they were having with him. We discovered soon after that he had withheld payments from multiple buyers dating as far back as the end of 2019 without fulfilling any of their orders. Benny was given ample opportunity to come up with the money to refund those he owed. After a week of stalling and the mod team's persistent follow-ups, we had no choice but to revoke Benny's TS status, which [the sub was made aware of via a PSA](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gypgbc/psa_removal_of_benny_from_the_ts_list/) in early June and [a second time](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/if4wfh/psa_benny_added_to_untrustworthy_seller_list/) in August. Unfortunately, save for one partial refund, we were unable to recover everyone's money. [It is our understanding that Benny did not initially set out to deceive and steal from anyone](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gypgbc/psa_removal_of_benny_from_the_ts_list/ftecv36/). He cited his father's death, Covid-19, and a seized shipment of leather as reasons for the setback. Nevertheless, as a result of [the dismaying number of affected individuals and total losses exceeding well over a grand](https://imgur.com/a/jmJKOnw), Benny's inability to rectify matters and do right by the people whose trust he betrayed necessitates his inclusion on this list.

#### Chris (Woopurse)

 - WeChat - jettrade

  - +86 131 1985 4201
  - 1 201 292 7982
 - Last known website - www.repladies.ru
 - Last known Instagram - [pursegarden](https://www.instagram.com/pursegarden/?hl=en)
 - Email - Repladies2017@gmail.com
 - Reddit username - `u/woopurse`
 - Former Instagram names - highluxcn, bagtrade, Alex Lin, Alice Bush, chanel lover, [pursesparty](https://www.instagram.com/pursegarden/?hl=en),  [luxury_bag_copy](https://www.instagram.com/luxury_bag_copy/?hl=en), [purse_queen_178](https://www.instagram.com/purse_queen_178/?hl=en), [d.pursesparty](https://www.instagram.com/d.pursesparty/?hl=en), and [chanelofficiai](https://www.instagram.com/chanelofficai/?hl=en)

Ignore the handful of positive reviews for woopurse and take your business elsewhere. In November 2017, he advertised a Black Friday sale on Chanel Mini Square CFs through WeChat. There were two instances where members did not receive their orders. `u/HollyGoLightlyNow` recounted her experience [here](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7j2vov/just_a_warning_when_ordering_from_woopurse/) and [here.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7m1h1s/woo_purse_update_he_blocked_me_no_bags_35_days/) Chris blocked her on WeChat after she requested his help with a possibly lost/seized package. In a separate order, he [failed to provide a tracking number](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7ukibq/help_need_advice_black_friday_order_never_arrived/) or any proof that he shipped `u/InfiniteVegetal`'s bag. He refused to respond to his customers (those he didn't block straightaway) and never replied to any of the messages the mod team sent to him through WeChat and Reddit.

Not content to simply steal from his clients, in February 2018, he [changed the domain](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/80oedh/purse_garden_email_new_name_repladies/) of his website from pursegarden.com to repladies.ru. He also created an email address using our name, which we’re concerned may give people the false impression that woopurse is affiliated with us in any way. Refer to our [PSA](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/80r53h/psa_repladies_has_no_affiliation_with/) for further information. Chris a sleazy scumbag who will take advantage of anyone and anything to make a quick buck.

#### de.mini_

 - Kakao - [de.mini_드미니](https://pf.kakao.com/_WxmrNj)
 - Former Instagram names - de.mini_, review_demini
 - Alias - abcdemini, dmini, mini

A Korean IG seller who [stole photos from RL](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/b48uao/psa_instagram_seller_deminidemini_stealing_photos/) including PSP taken by Heidi, DDmode, various other sellers, and several members' review pics. They watermarked them as their own and used them in fabricated reviews.

#### Eva Knox (PurseValley)

 - Last known websites
  - [PurseValley](http://www.pursevalleyfactory.com)
  - Perfect Watches
  - [Spotbags](http://www.spotbags.cn)

No rep seller has more negative reviews than PurseValley. The site was run by the infamous Eva Knox (aka Sophia Nolan) who also had a rep blog, Spotbags, comprised of “reviews” written by her and her “followers.” She used it to funnel business into PV and she was successful at it. Hence, the slew of “I’ve been scammed by PV and Eva” testimonials scattered all across the internet. PV never provided QC photos, overcharged by double if not more, frequently misrepresented the quality of their low-grade products, didn’t honor their exchange/return policies, and, in worst cases, stole money from their customers. 

PV came to an end on July 2017 when they were [reportedly busted by US and Chinese law enforcement](http://tech.sina.com.cn/roll/2017-11-14/doc-ifynsait8132014.shtml) (translator required) with Alibaba’s cooperation. Arrests were made, assets seized, and fines assessed. Imitation sites sprang up soon after to take advantage of PV’s name recognition. Although they are not run by Knox and her cronies, we advise you to avoid [pursevalley.ru](http://www.pursevalley.ru) and [pursevalleyvip.cn](http://www.pursevalleyvip.cn) anyway just to be safe.

- Reddit username - `u/Much-Ad5511`

This seller (if we can even call her that) [admitted to scamming](https://i.imgur.com/i7f7xoy.jpg). Please refer to [this PSA](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/tbga13/scammer_alert_faisoolee_muchad5511/).

#### [Ilona](https://imgur.com/a/h9OBL0t)

We respect that each member has the right to spend as much as they see fit. No judgments here: your money, your business. We also know that there are an almost limitless number of rep sellers to choose from. We don’t expect nor do we particularly care if you buy from a TS. Aside from concerns for your safety, we have no reason to insist upon it. Regardless, it remains our priority to help everyone make informed choices. 

Ilona is deservedly on this list due to her regular pattern of outrageously overcharging for low/mid-tier quality, and even more egregious, deceiving buyers by selling reps as authentic or grey market. [We strongly suspect her of shilling: offering undisclosed incentives for positive reviews to several users that extends beyond her advertised 10% off discount or free shipping.](https://imgur.com/jZlO1Ey) 

[There isn’t anyone on this planet who would sell an authentic Cartier Ballon Bleu watch for less than the $3000-4000 they’re going for secondhand.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/93om10/authentic_cartier_watch_from_ilona_review/)<sup>†</sup> A Louis Vuitton Pochette Metis, one of the most reviewed bags on RL, should not [cost $581](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/9fspuk/review_pochette_metis_monogram_lv_from_ilona/)<sup>†</sup> while having the same flaws (e.g. [bright red and uneven glazing](https://imgur.com/pQqdx44), [deep logo stamp on the handle](https://imgur.com/fJrRJdj), [long vachetta tab](https://imgur.com/wFKNW1A)) that you’d find on a $100 rep. Even the top-tier version from GF is no more than $350. Despite what she told the buyer, [it is not an “original quality” bag made for the Asian market.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/9fspuk/review_pochette_metis_monogram_lv_from_ilona/e5z2vx5/) That's not how LVMH operates. No custom order Chanel, especially with numerous glaring inaccuracies, should set anyone back [$900 plus an additional $82 for DHL](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/9hap8z/chanel_jumbo_chevron_lambskin_ghw_from_ilona/)<sup>†</sup> unless you are having it shipped to a remote research station in Antarctica. GF, the second most expensive Chanel rep factory, doesn’t come anywhere close to that even for their highest priced bag. They are generally regarded as one of the best Chanel factories alongside 187 and OF. [This chevron lambskin Jumbo](https://imgur.com/Pp8qcL6) is not from GF as Ilona claims. The proportions are completely wrong and GF doesn’t make those kinds of mistakes. Do some comparison shopping. Look up past reviews and QC threads where prices are listed. Ask several sellers for quotes before committing to a purchase. You can do better *and* pay less with anyone else whether they're a TS or not.

If Ilona has managed to convince you that you’re getting a product above and beyond what other sellers are offering, it is your prerogative to believe her. However, if you are weighing a purchase from Ilona, we ask you to reconsider. Whatever lines she’s feeding you about having private access to products coming from the same factory as the authentic and being able to pass them on to you at a steep discount, be aware that it’s an archetypal lie exploitative sellers have been regurgitating since the invention of the con. She’s just a drop shipper located in Russia, which means she doesn’t see nor touch any of the merchandise before it’s mailed to the customer unlike China-based sellers who can personally inspect and take photos of the product(s) for you. Despite her astronomical prices, she doesn’t usually provide PSP and when [she does,](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/aiut3z/review_chanel_classic_double_flap_medium_black/) she [lies about it.](https://imgur.com/a/HgBveH4) The bottom line is she's getting her inventory from the same factories as our TS and quoting an insane mark-up. In fact, one of the [Yupoo albums she uses](http://shishangbang1.x.yupoo.com/albums) is the supplier we refer to as “Grey Couch/Wood Table Factory,” which numerous other sellers have access to. Her products are not special, they’re most certainly not exclusive, and they are definitely *not* authentic.

Jennifer (also goes by Jen) is a bait and switch seller.  She claims that her bags are personally made-to-order by her, a preposterous fabrication. Multiple buyers have had negative experiences with her. The first, `u/meendo` purchased a [Goyard St. Louis GM.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/88iqd3/ig_seller_hermes_xo_jen_goyard_st_louis_tote/) Jennifer had told her she was located in South Korea, which has a reputation for making exclusive, high quality reps, yet the package was shipped from Guangzhou. Upon receipt of her bag, `u/meendo` saw that the print did not match up with the photos on IG, so `u/meendo` messaged Jennifer only to discover she had been blocked. Once Jennifer became aware of `u/meendo`'s review, she joined RL and made a piss poor attempt at damage control, which to her entails calling us cheap for shopping on TB. Such business savvy! When she realized it wasn’t working in her favor, Jennifer deleted all her comments, then proceeded to change her IG handle no less than five times that same day she was exposed. `u/meendo` later PMed Jennifer to see if she would be willing to refund her. Jennifer agreed on the condition that [the review be deleted and `u/meendo` refused.](https://imgur.com/a/YIGwq)

A second member, `u/cattyblue21`, purchased a Chanel Jumbo for $540. She waited two months for her order. When the bag finally arrived, not only did she receive the wrong size, it wasn’t the same quality as the bag shown in the pre-shipment video. `u/cattyblue21` contacted Jennifer who ignored all her messages. It wasn't until `u/cattyblue21` mentioned that she’d be sharing her bad experience on RL did Jennifer finally respond. She didn't deny that the bag in the video was different from the one she had shipped out and didn’t see it as a problem. When `u/cattyblue21` asked if she could return the CF for a refund, Jennifer declined and only offered an exchange after much prodding. In the end, the buyer was forced to chalk it up as a loss fearing that if Chinese customs didn't seize it first, Jennifer would keep the bag and not make good on her promise to send a replacement.

In July 2018, `u/BagloverDior` purchased a [Gucci Marmont bag from Jennifer for $300.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/8w3huo/untrustworthy_seller_ig_jluxury/) She contacted Jennifer a few times to find out when her bag would ship and never heard back, so she posted on RL to warn others. Jennifer saw the thread then [threatened](https://imgur.com/RiGPHEt) to report `u/BagloverDior` to WU and would dox her on IG. Again, she withheld a refund on the condition that the [post be removed](https://imgur.com/B3jxcF0). The confrontation concluded with Jennifer blocking `u/BagloverDior` who never ended up receiving her bag.

In a non-transactional incident, Jennifer [PMed](https://imgur.com/L3QCOZs) `u/Lvlover99` and asked her to delete a [post](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7o7fh6/an_ig_seller_is_she_legit/) where she had asked for feedback on hermes_xo. Jennifer was not pleased that the thread and comments rightfully questioning her legitimacy appeared in her Google search results. 

On top of being a vindictive bitch, Jennifer's also a pathological liar. She uses photos of auth products to sell low quality goods, a practice known as bait and switch. Jennifer habitually [steals pictures from @lamaisonh.official, an IG account belonging to an auth Hermès reseller in Seoul.](https://imgur.com/a/LK75lpP) If her reps look like they’re real, that's because they are. What she’s showing is *not* what you will be getting. We’ve seen her Chanel. They are dreadful Canal Street atrocities being sold at GF/187 prices. None of them are handmade by her and her small "team" in South Korea (she's changed her location to Japan as of November 13, 2020. The glowing reviews she shares on her other IG accounts, @hermes_xo_reviews, @boutiquebyj_reviews, and @jjj_reviews are also fake. Two of the review accounts were deleted twice and @jjj_reveiws is currently set to private as of mid-April 2018. She changed her name several more times on March 31, 2018 in an attempt to disassociate herself from the negative reviews and unflattering, yet truthful threads that populate when you Google "hermes_xo" and "j.luxury."

#### NewBagFactory (NBF)

 - Email - newbagfactory@hotmail.com
 - Former website - newbagfactory.mybigcommerce.com

Otherwise known as Tony and Dom or T&D. For the past decade, the duo was beloved for their Balenciaga City reps, which were widely considered to be the very best. Orders were frequently accompanied by long wait times as the bags were produced in limited batches and, of course, due to high demand. Those delays became excessive by the latter part of 2019. [A staggering number of buyers](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gye856/nbf_anyone_else_still_waiting_for_an_order/) shared their experiences of waiting over six months if not longer with hardly any communication or none at all from T&D. In many cases, the period to file a dispute with PayPal had lapsed taking away the only recourse some had to gain back the funds they'd lost.

In June, T&D sent a mass email that curiously enough, customers who were in the dark about their orders did not receive. In the message, [Dom revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gye856/nbf_anyone_else_still_waiting_for_an_order/fuwtokx/). Although the news was terribly sad and they likely received many abusive messages during that difficult time, they accepted no responsibility for how poorly they handled the entire situation. Although it is a deeply personal matter and Dom may not have wanted to make his health issues public, they still owed their clients some explanation without having to delve into their personal business. Instead, they chose to blame RL members specifically for having the gall to expect that T&D fulfill their obligations to them. Nevermind that everyone had been completely ignorant about their hardship up until that point and they made the conscious choice to accept payments for bags they knew they would not be able to send out within a reasonable timeframe. 

`u/fortheglowofit` [recounted in excruciating detail her frustrating transaction](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/gyy3mv/review_balenciaga_classic_city_mini_in_black_shw/). She was one of the lucky few who eventually received her bag. More recent commentary and updates can also be viewed [here](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/if4wfh/psa_benny_added_to_untrustworthy_seller_list/g2ltj5k/). The RL mod team was unable to remediate as NBF was one of the very few TS we did not have direct contact with nor any relationship whatsoever. Their inclusion on our TS List was based on their formerly sterling reputation and years of positive reviews in rep communities that existed before RL.

We sincerely hope Dom is able to beat his prognosis, however, our responsibility to our members dictates that we add T&D to the list in light of the fact that there are still a lot of people who haven't received their order and might never. It also appears they have not suspended operations and are continuing to take money from unsuspecting buyers in bad faith. If you were considering a Bal from them, don't.

This is a SYmode/Billy imposter. There are several of them, so you need to be careful. There is even a `u/symode` Reddit account, which we confirmed does not belong to Billy. The SYModeVip site lists an Atlanta, GA address. Trust us, Billy is not slinging Birkins out of ATL. [These con artists stole $3300 from an unsuspecting RL member.](https://www.unddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/7nygx2/symode_hermes_reviews/dtqiag6/) The legitimate SYmode/Billy does not have a website, WhatsApp, IG, a YT channel, nor does he take orders over email. He can only be reached through WeChat (symode2).
