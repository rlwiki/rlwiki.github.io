## How to find reps of whatever you're looking for

[W2C Acronym](./acronyms)

Ever been over at `r/designerreps`? That sub, while sometimes being really useful, seems it became 90% of [W2C] "Obscure item" or "Item that hasnt even arrived in stores". It's probably very hard for new members to find their way and know where to look for a rep of a specific article they fell in love with. So I decided to throw together a quick guide how I go about finding a specific rep, and hope that you ladies can add your techniques to it ☺️

1. I go through three steps to find a specific rep. The first step is to Google the product name or (for some brands like LV) the product code. If you find reps it means there are factories making it. On Google you can also find prices for second hand authentic which might be low enough that you prefer to cop pre-loved instead of hunting a rep. Next step taobao. Screenshot the item you're looking for and upload it in taobao image search. Check if the prices suggest it's a rep or authentic. These two steps take literally 2 minutes of effort and will find reps in 95% of cases - IF they exist.

2. If you didn't find anything and you're getting desperate, send a Screenshot to several individual sellers and ask them if they have it or know if it's made. Now this takes longer of course but most sellers reply quickly during their working hours. Alice and Annie are really good at finding things in my opinion. Fang has a good network, too, but she only sells high quality reps. Try some international sellers as well if you have contacts, as the Chinese sellers source from the same factories. If none of the sellers know anything it's not very probable that reps exist.

3. Now, if you're for example looking for a bag that is quite commonly repped, but you want it in a specific color/hw/leather and don't find it in the sellers' albums, send them a Screenshot and ask them if they have it. The rep World seems so amazing at first because we can have access to things that would be out of our reach (or buy more of them, or wear them out more often... Many cool things about reps) but unfortunately there aren't reps of everything brands have made. Stuff from previous seasons can be really hard to find. And you will usually not have that many choices when it comes to quality because there is probably only one factory, if any, still making it.
