- [Pricing Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IwyEbI02HqYHJm1QiqFKHtribKWkwxuiP9X-bdWO8U4/edit#gid=0) - Price is listed in all reviews and QCs. By using the thread filters embedded in the sidebar (desktop), the About tab (mobile and Reddit app), or running a search of the brand plus style name, you'll be able to see how much the buyer recently paid for that particular item. Prices are subject to change, so you should always confirm with the seller.
